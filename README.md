# Tejas-Portfolio-Site
 This is the future site to show my work off. It is built with Vanilla JS, HTML5, and CSS. I created a custom SVG with Sketch and converted it by following a tutorial I found online. For now I just have filler copy, but that will change along with the Work Section which will include other projects from my CodePen and things from my job (I was hired to work in Dev Relations the first week of the course!). I chose to go with a mobile first design approach that should be observable with my breakpoints and media queries. I wanted to build something that could be hosted with static site architecture. I wanted to do something with Javascript that really shows the power of JS rather than fits with the theme of the site, thus "Countdown to Present Town." I hope to add in some of my other projects like: https://codepen.io/terrafirmatrekker/pen/eLRRGM https://codepen.io/terrafirmatrekker/pen/OQKXRN https://codepen.io/terrafirmatrekker/pen/OXdgPv https://codepen.io/terrafirmatrekker/pen/YGRYaA & https://codepen.io/terrafirmatrekker/pen/aYXvgr I'd say the biggest challenge which I overthought was the CSS logo animation, eventually I want to learn to animate the vector paths, but settled with just the central logo. I hope you enjoyed my project as much as I did doing it! I want to thank the mentors for their time and patience throughout the course. 
 
 The features I implemented: 
 
 1. A JS component that calculates days until your birthday (Once you choose the date click outside of the calendar to run the calculator) 
 2. CSS animation of the center logo
 3. The use of flexbox
