# Tejas-Portfolio-Site
 This is the future site to show my work off. It is built with Vanilla JS, HTML5, and CSS. I created a custom SVG with Sketch and converted it by following a tutorial I found online. For now I just have filler copy, but that will change along with the Work Section which will include other projects from my CodePen and things from my job. 
 
 The features I implemented: 
 
 1. A JS component that calcualtes days until your birthday
 2. CSS animation of the center logo
 3. The use of flexbox

You can simply clone and open the html file on your computer or check out the codepen here: https://codepen.io/terrafirmatrekker/full/Zjjzrd
